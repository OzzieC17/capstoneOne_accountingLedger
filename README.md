## Key notes for code
- Deposits are positive
- Payments are saved as negatives(negated in code)
- In reports, the screen prints all options however only the "Search by vendor" feature is complete

## Future Improvements
- Check balance when it is 0
- Add tags
- Print on a new file
- Integrate larger values
